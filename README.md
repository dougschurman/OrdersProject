# OrdersProject
React JS web app using Material UI accessing an ASP.NET Core web API that uses Entity Framework Core and a SQL Server database.

Most challenging project up to this date as I was completely unfamiliar with Typescript, React, MUI, APIs, and C#. Through mentors and documentation, I was able to familiarize
myself with enterprise level practices and clean code, though I have a lot to improve on design and organization wise.

Currently using Docker to containerize the project and push it to Heroku for hosting, but this is still in progress and may change in the future.
